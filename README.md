# My Personal Dotfiles Chaos

Welcome to my personal dotfiles chaos! This is where I keep all my configurations for Neovim, Tmux, WezTerm, Starship, and Zsh. It’s a bit of a mess, but it’s my mess, and I love it.

## What's Inside?

- **Neovim**: Based on [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim), this setup is packed with plugins, custom keybindings, and the ever-stylish Tokyo Night Storm theme.
- **Tmux**: My multiplexer of choice, complete with custom keybindings, a Tokyo Night Storm theme from @janoamaral (https://github.com/janoamaral/tokyo-night-tmux), and a few handy plugins.
- **WezTerm**: Fast, modern, and dressed in Tokyo Night Storm, it’s my terminal of choice.
- **Starship**: A cross-shell prompt that’s both beautiful and fast—just like my coding sessions, and you can also choose Tokyo Night Theme.
- **Zsh**: My shell, supercharged with autocompletion, syntax highlighting, and, of course, Tokyo Night Storm.

## The Tokyo Night Storm Theme

I’m a bit obsessed with consistency, so you’ll find the Tokyo Night Storm theme across Neovim, WezTerm, and Tmux. It’s dark, moody, and gives my setup that perfect cyberpunk vibe.

## Installation

If you're ready to dive in:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh # Fingers crossed!
```
